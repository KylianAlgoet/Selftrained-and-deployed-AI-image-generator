# EXP-010 measurements - SD 1.5 text-only baseline @ 512x512

Measured values only - no quality judgement, no method selection.

Reading rules that travel with these numbers:

- `peak alloc MiB` is **per run** and is the figure used to compare influence levels.
- `peak reserved MiB` and `peak device MiB` are **process-level high-water marks**.
  Influence levels share one OS process per (method, resolution, tier), so these two
  columns must not be compared between levels. Comparison **between methods** remains
  valid, because each method runs in its own fresh process.
- img2img executes `int(steps x strength)` denoising steps, so a stronger reference is
  also faster. `s/eff step` is therefore reported alongside wall-clock seconds.
- img2img `strength` is **inverted**: a lower value means a stronger reference.
